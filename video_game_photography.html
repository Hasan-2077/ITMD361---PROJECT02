    <h2>Tools and How To Use the Tools</h2>
    <p>The two images above are photos that I took using Otis_inf photomode tool and mods for this game that can be found in Nexus Mods.</p>
    <p>Otis_inf tool is basically a photo-mode injection tool which runs while the game is running in order to work together. After injecting this tool into the game file, I can then change the weather, lighting, light effects, shading, and other miscellaneous aspects. I can also enable a virtual camera that follows the mouse cursor, allowing me to choose an appropriate angle to take my picture. Finally, the last thing I do before I take my shot is hot sampling the image frame, which is basically rendering the image into a higher resolution than the native monitor resolution in order to achieve a high-resolution image of the final picture.</p>
    <p>Besides the injection tool, I also have to use an app called Reshade where I can manipulate in-game assets such as image sharpening, color saturation, realistic exposure, and depth of field (DOF) among many others.</p>
    <p>Otis_inf photo-mode tool is made by an artist called Otis on Patreon. This tool is available for most modern triple-A titles.</p>

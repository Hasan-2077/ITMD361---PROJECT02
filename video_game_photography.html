      <p class="light-blue-text">The five images above are photos that I took using Otis_inf photomode tool and mods for this game that can be found in Nexus Mods</p>
      <p class="light-blue-text">Otis_inf tool is basically a photo-mode injection tool which runs while the game is running in order to work together.</p>
      <p class="light-blue-text">Besides the injection tool, I also have to use an app called Reshade where I can manipulate in-game assets such as image sharpening, light settings, field of view, lens aperture, and long exposure units.</p>
